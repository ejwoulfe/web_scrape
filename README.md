Web Scraping project to make BDO Profit's database

This was one of my earlier projects, I really wanted to make a full stack website but the data I wanted to retrieve wasn't implemented in a public API, so I made my own database.
I used Node.js and Puppeteer, which is made by the google chrome dev team!
It was a lot of fun and frustration, but I learned a lot. My organization skills weren't the best here...
